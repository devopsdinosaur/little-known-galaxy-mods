        "libraryBody": "Meeting an intelligent lifeform for the first time can be tricky, as official protocols for first contact range widely depending on the situation at hand. It is important to note our primary goal in greeting a new species is always to form a peaceful understanding between our cultures. This is of the utmost importance.\n\nWe take for granted our own cultural norms as a standard for all regular encounters, but this can be a dangerous assumption for first contact. For example, a friendly smile could instead be interpreted as a threatening show of teeth. Body language cues like eye contact, gesturing, sounds, or even smells should be considered without bias. The truth is we have no way of establishing a set of rules that will apply to every situation since we cannot predict every type of lifeform we might encounter.\n\nWhile trying to establish communication, please remember to use your best judgement and be adaptable to the present situation. When in doubt, please refer to your local Central Processing Unit for guidance and advice."

Humans began taking luxurious vacations into space, until the Earth's orbit was completely overrun with private satellites and overpriced gimmicky resorts.\n\nOn a mission to reclaim space exploration beyond simple novelty, a group of like-minded scientists established The Earth & Space Alliance. Its mission was to develop a set of rules and guidelines to work collaboratively as a planet instead of privately. Astrophysicists, researchers, and even private citizens from around the globe began sharing their funding, trade secrets, and technology with each other. All in an effort to further The Earth & Space Alliance's guiding vision."

Many of these civilizations, far superior to our own, offered their technology and friendship to the united people of Earth. The name was shortened to Space Alliance as more and more species joined the cause as well. These advancements have dramatically improved the organization, and Space Alliance's never-ending desire to explore the stars continues on to this day."

So, the bear wished for a thick comfortable blanket to make the winter warmer in his cave. POOF!

They knocked the front door right down and chased us all the way back into our bedroom next. We slammed that door closed too.  But we heard the tiny footsteps coming again we knew we were in trouble. The bedroom door creaked open and we saw the aliens were still after us!  We were not afraid anymore and both said 'That’s the last straw, this is our house!'\n\nSo we charged at the aliens and did a flying cartwheel right over their heads. Both of us ran out of the house and snatched up their spaceship not even stopping to turn around at all. We rolled that bowling ball ship right down the snow bank for a ten pin STRIKE! When we returned to our house the aliens were nowhere in sight. Next a faraway noise was heard, and we saw that little spaceship flying away.\n\nThe next morning our mother asked us what all the ruckus was, and what happened last night.

Since they tend to just go about their business without cause or concern for other organisms, they have received this reputation.\n\nMost of these microbes do not help or hurt a space ship or its crew, but they are still a large part of what you will find when you sample your local microbe community. They often have both positive and negative traits that tend to balance out, in fact. The presence of these microbes can sometimes even be an indicator of a healthy microbiome aboard your vessel, so you can feel neutral about them."
